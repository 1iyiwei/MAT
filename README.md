# Medial Axis Transform (MAT) - SVG focused
A pure javascript Medial/Scale Axis Transform (MAT/SAT) library.

## [Demo](http://mat-demo.appspot.com)

The MAT is an analytical form of skeletonization of a shape. It is perfectly suited to SVG. Described by many scholars as *the most important image transform*, it has endless use cases, e.g.:
* **Morphing of one shape into another**
* **Shape thinning or fattening**
* **Shape classification**
* **Shape simplification**
* **Image compression**

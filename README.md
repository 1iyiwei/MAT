# Medial Axis Transform (MAT) - SVG focus
A Medial Axis Transform (MAT) and Scale Axis Transform (SAT) library with a focus on SVG shapes.

The Medial Axis Transform (or MAT) is an analytical form of skeletonization of a shape. It is thus perfectly suited to SVG. Described by many scholars as *the most important image transform*, it has endless use cases:
* **Morphing of one shape into another**
* **Shape thinning or fattening**
* **Shape classification**
* **Shape simplification**
* **Image compression**
* etc.
